Hey there! 😊✨ My name is Emily (she/her) and I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at University of North Carolina - Greensboro. I currently work as a ```Quality Assurance Test Automation Engineer``` based in North Carolina working on an East Coast Remote QA team. 


- 🎨 Hobbies: my free-time is all about [art - I have a TikTok!](https://www.tiktok.com/@winfieid99) 🖌️, camping ⛺, gaming 👾, and binging my favorite SCI-FI shows 👩‍🚀
- 🌱 Currently learning my way around a Python framework, Robot Framework, and how to utilize Javascript and Python to enhance testcases. 
- 🤖 Projects: most of my work on GitHub is a showcase of assignments I have completed during my undergrad career, but I'm starting up a new project ```parabankAutomation``` to showcase my knowledge in automating FinTech user flows
